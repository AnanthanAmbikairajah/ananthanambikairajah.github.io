# CAREER OBJECTIVE
My career objective is to work in an intellectually challenging environment that combines my passion for research, teaching and science communication, as well as enriched opportunities to be a lifelong learner.

# MISSION STATEMENT

I am determined and committed to: 

* Conduct high quality research investigating genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors which influence ageing, brain health and disease, with a particular focus on sex-specific determinants, cardiometabolic factors and the potential for risk reduction in dementia.
* Enhance student motivation and engagement to promote positive learning experiences and outcomes which foster a love of learning and facilitates a journey of personal growth and self-discovery.
* Communicate science with a focus on making it accessible, understandable and interesting, which can spark public engagement, facilitate critical thinking and encourage respectful discourse. 
* Integrate principles of openness and a data-centred approach, leveraging tools and technology, including R, git, Linux and Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), to enhance the capabilities, efficiency and impact of teaching, research and service.
